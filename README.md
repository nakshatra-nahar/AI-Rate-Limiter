Implementing an **AI-based rate limiter** involves augmenting traditional rate limiting strategies with machine learning (ML) or AI techniques to **dynamically adjust, detect anomalies, and make smarter decisions** based on usage patterns. This is especially useful in systems with varying loads, complex user behavior, or potential abuse vectors.

## 🧠 What is an AI-Based Rate Limiter?

A **rate limiter** traditionally enforces fixed rules (e.g., 100 requests/minute). An **AI-based rate limiter**, however, learns from traffic patterns, predicts possible abuse, adjusts limits dynamically, and can even differentiate between benign and malicious users.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Components:
1. **Traffic Ingestion Layer**  
   Collects metadata from incoming requests (IP, headers, user ID, endpoint, time).

2. **Feature Extraction Module**  
   Converts raw request data into meaningful vectors (e.g., request frequency, payload types, endpoint usage patterns).

3. **ML Model / Heuristic Engine**  
   Predicts abuse or throttling need:
   - Classification Model → `Abuse` vs `Benign`
   - Regression Model → Predict safe rate limit
   - Anomaly Detection → Flag unusual spikes

4. **Decision Engine**  
   Makes rate-limiting decisions based on model output and fallbacks.

5. **Storage Layer (optional)**  
   For storing past behavior, model features, and logs.

6. **Feedback Loop**  
   Allows the model to retrain over time as user behavior changes.

## 🧩 ML-Based Strategies You Can Use

### 1. **Supervised Classification Model**
- **Goal**: Predict if a user or request is abusive.
- **Data**: Labeled data on good vs abusive request patterns.
- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, or Neural Nets.
- **Feature Examples**:
  - Requests/sec, error codes ratio
  - Time between requests
  - Endpoint access diversity
  - IP reputation

### 2. **Time Series Anomaly Detection**
- Use algorithms like Isolation Forest, ARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM.
- Train on historical request rates.
- Detect unexpected spikes or usage drops.

### 3. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**
- Dynamic rate limiter that learns the best throttling policy based on:
  - Traffic impact on backend
  - Reward: minimizing abuse while maximizing legit access
  - Penalty: incorrectly throttling valid users

### 4. **Online Learning**
- Useful for streaming systems (Kafka, Pulsar).
- Continuously updates model weights based on recent data (e.g., Vowpal Wabbit or River).

## 🛡️ Decision Policies

Based on the model's output:

| Model Output         | Action                        |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| High Abuse Risk      | Block or apply stricter limit |
| Moderate Risk        | Apply dynamic throttling      |
| Low Risk             | Allow or increase limit       |
| Anomaly Detected     | Flag and degrade performance  |

You can also combine with traditional techniques like:
- Token Bucket
- Leaky Bucket
- Sliding Window
...but **adjust their parameters based on the ML model**.

## 📦 Example Flow

```
1. Incoming Request → Metadata Logged
2. Features Extracted: {IP, time_gap, endpoint, payload_type, …}
3. Model Predicts: {risk_score: 0.82}
4. RateLimiter: if risk_score > 0.8 → Block
                       else if 0.5 < risk_score < 0.8 → Throttle to 10 RPM
                       else → Allow
5. Log & Feedback Loop for model retraining
```

## 📊 Metrics to Track

- False Positives / Negatives
- Precision / Recall
- Avg Response Time under load
- API Error rate vs Model Confidence
- Backend CPU/Mem usage with AI vs baseline

---

## 🔁 Continuous Learning

- Periodically re-train models based on feedback (monthly or event-based).
- Use unsupervised methods to bootstrap labels (clustering + heuristic flags).
- Use shadow mode first (model observes, doesn't act).

---

## ⚠️ Challenges

| Problem | Solution |
|--------|----------|
| Cold Start | Use hybrid: static rules + AI |
| Exploit AI Model | Obfuscate features; add randomness |
| Real-time Latency | Optimize model size; use quantized models |
| Lack of Labeled Data | Use semi-supervised / active learning |

## 💡 Bonus: Behavior-Based Adaptive Limits

Instead of static "100 req/min", assign **per-user adaptive limits**:
- New user → 20 req/min
- Trusted user → 1000 req/min
- Risky IP → 5 req/min or block

AI decides this dynamically. 🎯
